Animals like the wolf also understand such connections and are better at this than their domesticated descendants. Researchers say that wolves have a better causal understanding than dogs and that they follow human-given communicative cues equally well. The study provides insight that the process of domestication can also affect an animal's causal understanding.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095154.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Wolves understand cause and effect better than dogs","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095154.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Wolves understand cause and effect better than dogs","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170915095154-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914210618.htm","published":1505437578,"updated":1505437578,"title":"Thirdhand smoke exposure effects on liver and brain found to worsen over time","summary":"Thirdhand-smoke results when exhaled smoke and smoke emanating from the tip of burning cigarettes gets on surfaces such as clothing, hair, homes, and cars.
