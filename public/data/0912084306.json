It's real! On September 5th, the Symfony Components crossed a huge\nlandmark: the <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://symfony.com/stats/downloads\">1 billionth download</a>! This happened less than <em>one</em> year after\nthe last milestone: <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"http://symfony.com/blog/symfony-reaches-500-million-downloads\">500 million downloads</a>. That's right: the PHP community downloaded\nthe Symfony components more than 500 million times in just one year.

There are now over <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://symfony.com/stats/downloads\">80 Symfony packages</a> and 1,500 people\nhave contributed code to these. None of this is possible without your help. Congrats!</p>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"the-symfony-components-upgrading-to-symfony-4\">\n<h1>The Symfony Components &amp; Upgrading to Symfony 4<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#the-symfony-components-upgrading-to-symfony-4\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h1>\n<p>How is it possible to have <em>so</em> many downloads? The Symfony components are of course\nused in the Symfony Framework... but that's only the start. Today, you'll find some\nparts of Symfony in almost every major PHP project, like Drupal, Laravel, Composer,\nOroCRM, Akeneo PIM and <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://symfony.com/projects\">many, many others</a>. This is a great honor, and also a\nserious responsibility.</p>\n<p>To handle this, Symfony created a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://symfony.com/bc\">Backwards Compatibility Promise</a>: a commitment\nto strictly follow semantic versioning so that anyone using Symfony can safely and\nconfidently upgrade. Symfony also has a <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://symfony.com/roadmap\">predictable release cycle</a>: a minor release\nevery 6 months, with a long-term support (LTS) release every 2 years.</p>\n<p>Symfony 4 will be <a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://symfony.com/roadmap?version=4.0#checker\">released in November 2017</a>. And since this is a major version, it\n<em>will</em> contain backwards compatibility breaks. In many ways, that's unacceptable:\nSymfony users (developers &amp; projects) need to be able to upgrade their code without\nintroducing bugs or spending countless hours reading the CHANGELOG and hunting for\nchanges.</p>\n<p>That's why - just like with Symfony 3 - we continue to use our\n<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://www.slideshare.net/nicolas.grekas/migrating-to-symfony-30/30\">Continuous Upgrade Path</a>: a system where deprecated features trigger deprecation\nnotices that can be seen in Symfony's web debug toolbar, or after running your tests.\nThis allows you to update your code little-by-little, at your own pace. When you've\nremoved all the deprecated calls, upgrading is easy and safe. With the continuous\nupgrade path, your project is never left behind. That's very important.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"to-the-next-billion-and-symfony-4\">\n<h1>To the next Billion! And Symfony 4!<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#to-the-next-billion-and-symfony-4\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">¶</a></h1>\n<p>1 billion downloads is an unimaginable number! And so I'm so excited to see where\nwe go next. Symfony 4 will introduce a whole new way of composing micro or monolithic\napps. The goals are lofty: faster development (RAD), more clarity, increased control\nand faster code.
