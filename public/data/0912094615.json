It looked at different combinations of ground treatments to reduce competition from other vegetation and of regeneration methods, such as planting spruce seedlings and broadcast seeding. The results show the environmental and management situations in which different techniques work best and the situations in which they are unnecessary. Results support the state's current reforestation practices.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134820.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Forest regeneration experiment of 30 years yields results","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134820.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Forest regeneration experiment of 30 years yields results","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170912134820-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134802.htm","published":1505238482,"updated":1505238482,"title":"Historic legacies affect climate change survival in Caribbean","summary":"Discussion of climate change has failed to pay enough attention to the social, political and historic factors which increase the vulnerability of Caribbean societies, and calls for a new approach focused on understanding and addressing these historic inequalities.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134802.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Historic legacies affect climate change survival in Caribbean","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134802.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
