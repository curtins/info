The reason for this has been unknown. Researchers have now shown that this is due to a previously underestimated effect: the 'interatomic coulomb decay' allows the atom to transfer its energy to several other atoms simultaneously. This also explains why radiation therapy can be so effective.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122635.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Hollow atoms: The consequences of an underestimated effect","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122635.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Hollow atoms: The consequences of an underestimated effect","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170911122635-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
