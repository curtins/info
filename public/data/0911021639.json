It is particularly closely monitored, to prevent the risks of outbreaks and invasions.

Although there are numerous strategies to detect it, they are not sufficiently selective and sensitive to differentiate close animal species. A collaboration of experts has developed an electrochemical biosensor capable of detecting, in just one hour, processes of adulteration of beef with horse meat.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911095908.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Biosensor detects adulteration of horse in beef meat within one hour","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911095908.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170909194039.htm","published":1505000439,"updated":1505000439,"title":"Study challenges perception that empathy erodes during medical school","summary":"A new study by social neuroscientists challenges the common perception that empathy declines during medical training.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170909194039.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Study challenges perception that empathy erodes during medical school","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170909194039.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
