For years, scientists thought the ancestors of today's humans, monkeys, lemurs and apes were relatively slow and deliberate animals, using their grasping hands and feet to creep along small twigs and branches.

The jets of plasma that doctors might use, however, often become turbulent with the direction and velocity changing dramatically. Now, researchers have found this turbulence likely emerges from heat-induced sound waves generated at the plasma electrodes. This new insight is critical for more consistent and effective medical therapies.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122711.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"The turbulent healing powers of plasma","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122711.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122709.htm","published":1505147229,"updated":1505147229,"title":"A novel and practical fab-route for superomniphobic liquid-free surfaces","summary":"Scientists have developed a fabrication technology that can inexpensively produce surfaces capable of repelling liquids, including water and oil.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122709.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"A novel and practical fab-route for superomniphobic liquid-free surfaces","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122709.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"A novel and practical fab-route for superomniphobic liquid-free surfaces","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170911122709-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122706.htm","published":1505147226,"updated":1505147226,"title":"Connecting up the quantum internet","summary":"Major leap for practical building blocks of a quantum internet: New research demonstrates how to dramatically improve the storage time of a telecom-compatible quantum memory, a vital component of a global quantum network.
