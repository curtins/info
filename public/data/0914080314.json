During earlier observations, it was not possible to cover the whole cloud, whose shape was predicted by numerical simulations. Thanks to these new observations, the scientists have finally been able to confirm the initial predictions.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152314.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"The return of the comet-like exoplanet","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152314.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152312.htm","published":1505416992,"updated":1505416992,"title":"'Handedness' in scale-eating fish: Nature and nurture","summary":"Lateralized behaviors are thought to be strengthened during development. However, little is known about how they are acquired during development. In the scale-eating cichlid model, researchers demonstrated the attack side preference of juveniles was developed with scale-eating experience, regardless of age. They also found that kinetics of attack behavior is superior on one side by nature. Therefore, they concluded that the fish learn to use the naturally dominant side through experience.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152312.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"'Handedness' in scale-eating fish: Nature and nurture","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152312.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152256.htm","published":1505416976,"updated":1505416976,"title":"Could interstellar ice provide the answer to birth of DNA?","summary":"Molecules brought to Earth in meteorite strikes could potentially be converted into the building blocks of DNA, researchers have shown.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152256.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Could interstellar ice provide the answer to birth of DNA?","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152256.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
