These modifications greatly increase the diversity of protein structure and function, affecting how proteins fold, how they behave, and where they go in cells. New research demonstrates that a rare type of glycosylation profoundly affects the function of a protein important for human development and cancer progression.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170917120325.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Sugary secrets of a cancer-related protein","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170917120325.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
