These results provide new insights into the biologic networks involved in IBD with potential to identify new targets and eventually novel interventions for the treatment of patients living with IBD.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122606.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Scientists construct first predictive model of inflammatory bowel disease","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122606.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205446.htm","published":1504918486,"updated":1504918486,"title":"Blocking sweet taste receptors can help body fight off sinus infections","summary":"Sweet taste receptor, known as T1R, can be activated by certain amino acids secreted by bacteria. Researchers took cells from rhinosinusitis patients and isolated the various communities of bacteria that were present. They found cultures of Staphylococcus bacteria produced two D-amino acids called D-Phe and D-Leu, both of which activate T1R sweet receptors and block the release of antimicrobial peptides.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205446.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Blocking sweet taste receptors can help body fight off sinus infections","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205446.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205423.htm","published":1504918463,"updated":1504918463,"title":"Polio-like disease in children","summary":"In Germany in the summer and autumn of 2016, several cases of illness in children were observed that were accompanied by acute flaccid paralysis.
