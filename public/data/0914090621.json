Scientists reveal that the people there have remained genetically independent from Europe and Asia for most of the last 50,000 years, and that people from the country's isolated highlands region have been completely independent even until the present day.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152337.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Huge genetic diversity among Papuan New Guinean peoples revealed","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152337.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Huge genetic diversity among Papuan New Guinean peoples revealed","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170914152337-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152235.htm","published":1505416955,"updated":1505416955,"title":"'Mysterious' ancient creature was definitely an animal, research confirms","summary":"It lived well over 550 million years ago, is known only through fossils and has variously been described as looking a bit like a jellyfish, a worm, a fungus and lichen.

Renewable hydrogen can already be produced by photoelectrolysis where solar power is used to split water molecules into oxygen and hydrogen. But fundamental problems remain before this can be adopted commercially due to inefficiency. A new study demonstrates that the novel use of nanostructures could increase the maximum photovoltage generated in a photoelectrochemical cell, increasing the productivity of splitting water molecules.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152228.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Hydrogen power moves a step closer","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152228.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
