To make these new antibodies, cells in the immune system must intentionally damage their own genes, meaning they run the risk of becoming cancer cells. New research reveals how a proteins called Tia1 acts as a hair-trigger for DNA repair, allowing the immune system to walk the line between health and harm.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084427.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"A hair-trigger for cells fighting infection","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084427.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912154844.htm","published":1505245724,"updated":1505245724,"title":"A one-of-a-kind star found to change over decades","summary":"Researchers recently found new evidence that lends support to an existing theory of how the unusual star emits energy.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912154844.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"A one-of-a-kind star found to change over decades","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912154844.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"A one-of-a-kind star found to change over decades","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170912154844-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
