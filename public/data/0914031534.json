They provide policymakers and the media tools to navigate and address key issues related to the delivery of health care and the development of health policy.</p>\n<p>AcademyHealth needed a strategic design partner (in this case, Palantir.net) to help them modernize their website through the adoption of responsive design, streamlined topic-based information architecture and integration of additional context for featured publications and other content.</p>\n<p>They also sought to improve the experience for their editors and the people who manage the content, look and feel of the website. AcademyHealthâ€™s marketing and communication team members wanted a content management framework that would afford the communication team with exclusive live editing privileges and cue other content editors as to when content is being worked on and when it has been approved. </p></div></div></div>","permalinkUrl":"https://www.drupal.org/node/2908872","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"AcademyHealth","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.drupal.org/node/2908872","type":"text/html"}],"replies":[{"title":"AcademyHealth","rel":"replies","href":"https://www.drupal.org/node/2908872#comments","type":"text/html"}]},"actor":{"displayName":"Adam Hawes","id":"Adam Hawes"},"language":"en"}]}
