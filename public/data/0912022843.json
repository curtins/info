The research reveals a mechanism that generates a 20,000 km long atmospheric bridge, reaching from Antarctica to the Arctic.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912093056.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Ancient tree reveals cause of spike in Arctic temperature","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912093056.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912093047.htm","published":1505223047,"updated":1505223047,"title":"Rapid climate changes across northern hemisphere in the earliest Middle Pleistocene","summary":"By studying climate changes that took place thousands of years ago, we can better understand the global climate system and predict Earth's future climate.
