Researchers in Brazil have found that mouse skin responds to caloric restriction by stimulating fur growth, increasing blood flow, and altering cell metabolism to increase energy efficiency. The study reveals that animals may use this as an evolutionary adaptation to stay warm -- and alive -- in limited food conditions.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134817.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"In mice, calorie restriction reduces fat but increases fur","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134817.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
