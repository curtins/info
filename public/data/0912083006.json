The research team demonstrated a protein called SIDT2 was crucial for cells to detect viral components in their environment, and initiate an immune response to reduce the virus' spread.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134812.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"'Missing link' explains how viruses trigger immunity","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134812.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134809.htm","published":1505238489,"updated":1505238489,"title":"Reversing the negative effects of adolescent marijuana use","summary":"Researchers have identified a specific mechanism in the prefrontal cortex for some of the negative mental health risks associated with adolescent marijuana use. By demonstrating that adolescent THC exposure modulates the activity of a neurotransmitter called GABA in the prefrontal cortex region of the brain, they were also able to identify a mechanism to reverse those risks.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134809.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Reversing the negative effects of adolescent marijuana use","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134809.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134807.htm","published":1505238487,"updated":1505238487,"title":"New way to stabilize next-generation fusion plasmas","summary":"Recent experiments conducted on the DIII-D National Fusion Facility suggest that up to 40 percent of high-energy particles are lost during tokamak fusion reactions because of Alfv√©n waves.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134807.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"New way to stabilize next-generation fusion plasmas","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134807.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134805.htm","published":1505238485,"updated":1505238485,"title":"Magnetic cellular 'Legos' for the regenerative medicine of the future","summary":"By incorporating magnetic nanoparticles in cells and developing a system using miniaturized magnets, researchers have succeeded in creating cellular magnetic 'Legos.'
