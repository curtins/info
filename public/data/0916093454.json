An international group of researchers have put a literal twist on this challenge, demonstrating a new nanoscale optomechanical resonator that can detect torsional motion at near state-of-the-art sensitivity. Their resonator, into which they couple light, also demonstrates torsional frequency mixing, a novel ability to impact optical energies using mechanical motions.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170916080147.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Sensing with a twist: A new kind of optical nanosensor uses torque for signal processing","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170916080147.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Sensing with a twist: A new kind of optical nanosensor uses torque for signal processing","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170916080147-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170916080143.htm","published":1505563303,"updated":1505563303,"title":"Fertility research brings death of dogma, birth of hope","summary":"A new study shows unequivocally that stem cells in the ovaries are a critical piece of the mammal fertility puzzle, and may be harnessed to revolutionize fertility treatments and perhaps even delay menopause.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170916080143.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Fertility research brings death of dogma, birth of hope","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170916080143.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915165403.htm","published":1505508843,"updated":1505508843,"title":"Tracing the light inside a LED","summary":"The performance of white LED's can be improved, based on better knowledge of the absorption and scattering of light inside the LED.
