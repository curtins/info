This discovery sheds new light on the atmospheric composition of the planet and also refutes previous hypotheses about WASP-12b's atmosphere. The results are also in stark contrast to observations of another similarly sized exoplanet.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152233.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Hubble observes pitch black planet","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152233.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Hubble observes pitch black planet","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170914152233-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
