The study found that hip fracture sufferers experienced significantly worse survival at 12-months post-fracture. Individuals with hip fracture were more than 3.5 times more likely to die within 12 months compared to their non-injured counterpart, and excess mortality was higher in men than in women.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907143003.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Hip fracture often deadly, study shows","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907143003.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907132533.htm","published":1504805133,"updated":1504805133,"title":"Streamlined security: Optimizing sensor placement with mathematics","summary":"Increasing reliance on heightened security in public and private settings calls for optimal sensor technology. However, placing security sensors to optimize resource management and system performance while simultaneously protecting people and products is undoubtedly challenging. In a new paper, experts propose a computational level set method to optimally position a sensor-based security system for maximum surveillance of a complex environment.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907132533.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Streamlined security: Optimizing sensor placement with mathematics","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907132533.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
