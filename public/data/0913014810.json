The study is the first to provide evidence linking structural changes with behavioral changes within this context. Understanding the intentions of others is fundamental to human cooperation and how we exist as social beings.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084448.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Teens' ability to consider the intentions of others linked to structural changes in the brain","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084448.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084445.htm","published":1505306685,"updated":1505306685,"title":"Paper-based tuberculosis test could boost diagnoses in developing countries","summary":"Diagnosing tuberculosis early can allow patients to receive the medicine they need and also help prevent the disease from spreading. But in resource-limited areas, equipment requirements and long wait times for results are obstacles to diagnosis and treatment. To tackle this problem, scientists report the development of a fast, paper-based tuberculosis test that can be read with a smartphone.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084445.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Paper-based tuberculosis test could boost diagnoses in developing countries","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084445.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084443.htm","published":1505306683,"updated":1505306683,"title":"Systems analysis points to links between Toxoplasma infection and common brain diseases","summary":"Nearly one out of every three humans on earth has a lifelong infection with the brain-dwelling parasite Toxoplasma gondii.
