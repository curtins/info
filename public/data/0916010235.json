The most well-known of these substances, which are scientifically denoted as contaminants, are mercury compounds and dioxins. In contrast, only around 13 percent of respondents have heard of the natural contaminants pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in honey or tea - and only roughly one in three of those who have heard of PAs believe these substances pose a significant health risk.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095156.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Contaminants in food: Health risks of natural origin are frequently underestimated","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095156.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152422.htm","published":1505417062,"updated":1505417062,"title":"Mixing artificial sweeteners inhibits bitter taste receptors","summary":"Blends of artificial sweeteners such as saccharin and cyclamate produce less of a bitter off-taste than each of the individual components, but the explanation for this puzzling phenomenon has been elusive ever since its discovery more than 60 years ago. A study solves this long-standing mystery, revealing that saccharin inhibits the activity of bitter taste receptors stimulated by cyclamate and, conversely, that cyclamate reduces the off-taste elicited by saccharin.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152422.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Mixing artificial sweeteners inhibits bitter taste receptors","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152422.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152417.htm","published":1505417057,"updated":1505417057,"title":"Scientists find potential mechanism for deadly, sepsis-induced secondary infection","summary":"In mice, an infection-induced condition known as sepsis may increase the risk of life-threatening secondary infection by preventing recruitment of infection-fighting cells to the skin, according to new research.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152417.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Scientists find potential mechanism for deadly, sepsis-induced secondary infection","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152417.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Scientists find potential mechanism for deadly, sepsis-induced secondary infection","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170914152417-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170914152357.htm","published":1505417037,"updated":1505417037,"title":"You're not alone in feeling alone","summary":"Feel like everyone else has more friends than you do?
