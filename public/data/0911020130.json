Analyses of mice song can provide important information about their social behavior and for research into neuropsychiatric disorders. But their songs are in the ultrasonic range and inaudible for humans. Researchers have now developed a freely available method to automatically detect mouse vocalizations instead of manually.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205510.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"A-MUD: A method for automatically detecting mouse song","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205510.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"A-MUD: A method for automatically detecting mouse song","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170908205510-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205450.htm","published":1504918490,"updated":1504918490,"title":"New guidelines discourage use of brain imaging as a 'lie detector' for chronic pain","summary":"A task force consisting of researchers from around the world has released a set of recommendations that advise against the use of brain imaging as a test for chronic pain.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205450.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"New guidelines discourage use of brain imaging as a 'lie detector' for chronic pain","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205450.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205417.htm","published":1504918457,"updated":1504918457,"title":"Meeting a microbe in the morning or in the evening: Is it all the same?","summary":"Does the time of day matter when our body is infected by a parasite?
