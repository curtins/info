Now, a new study has identified new signals of adaptation across multiple genes and exploring a rich demographic history. By performing extensive analyses on DNA sequencing data for two North-Central Siberian populations, the Nganasan (nomadic hunters) and Yakut (herders), they have been able to infer the most comprehensive demographic and adaptive history.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912170505.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Cold comfort: Fat-rich diets and adaptation among indigenous Siberian populations","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912170505.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
