With the aid of a process called density gradient centrifugation, a research team recently published a study that for the first time characterizes all of the circular DNA in the wormÂ C. elegans, as well as in three human cell types.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911163239.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Study of circular DNA comes full circle with use of old technique","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911163239.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Study of circular DNA comes full circle with use of old technique","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170911163239-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205548.htm","published":1504918548,"updated":1504918548,"title":"Do we need to reform international drug treaties as more countries legalize cannabis?","summary":"The future of international drug control treaties is in doubt because of recent treaty-violating decisions to legalize cannabis use in Canada, the United States and Uruguay. A professor, whose 2014 review of 20 years of cannabis research made world headlines, thinks so. If decriminalization is the way of the future, he advocates a cautious approach to policy reform that would involve trialing and evaluating the effects of incrementally more liberal drug policies.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205548.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Do we need to reform international drug treaties as more countries legalize cannabis?","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170908205548.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
