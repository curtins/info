But according to some researchers, it won’t be long before a computer program can accurately guess whether people are liberal or conservative in an instant. All that will be needed are photos of their faces. </p><p>Michal Kosinski – the Stanford University professor who went viral last week for research suggesting that artificial intelligence (AI) can detect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/07/new-artificial-intelligence-can-tell-whether-youre-gay-or-straight-from-a-photograph\">whether people are gay or straight based on photos</a> – said sexual orientation was just one of many characteristics that algorithms would be able to predict through facial recognition. Using photos, AI will be able to identify people’s political views, whether they have high IQs, whether they are predisposed to criminal behavior, whether they have specific personality traits and many other private, personal details that could carry huge social consequences, he said. </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/artificial-intelligence-face-recognition-michal-kosinski\">Continue reading...</a>","permalinkUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/artificial-intelligence-face-recognition-michal-kosinski","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Face-reading AI will be able to detect your politics and IQ, professor says","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/sep/12/artificial-intelligence-face-recognition-michal-kosinski","type":"text/html"}],"enclosure":[{"title":"Face-reading AI will be able to detect your politics and IQ, professor says","rel":"enclosure","href":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73a8c4898359192c3d3501ef20eb71fe8d19fb75/365_316_2015_1208/master/2015.jpg?w=140&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=01c69d267eccfa5e4cf2ffbb87251fea"},{"title":"Face-reading AI will be able to detect your politics and IQ, professor says","rel":"enclosure","href":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/73a8c4898359192c3d3501ef20eb71fe8d19fb75/365_316_2015_1208/master/2015.jpg?w=460&q=55&auto=format&usm=12&fit=max&s=0aeb25186faf93a6e749224e08bf2e3e"}]},"actor":{"displayName":"Sam Levin in San Francisco","id":"Sam Levin in San Francisco"},"categories":["Facial recognition","Technology","US news"],"source":{"id":"technology-the-guardian-2017-9-12-7","title":"Technology | The Guardian","updated":1505199982,"permalinkUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Technology | The Guardian","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology","type":"text/html"}],"image":[{"title":"The Guardian","rel":"image","href":"https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/guardian-logo-rss.c45beb1bafa34b347ac333af2e6fe23f.png","type":"image/png"}],"superfeedr":[{"title":"","rel":"superfeedr","href":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology/rss"}]},"image":"https://assets.guim.co.uk/images/guardian-logo-rss.c45beb1bafa34b347ac333af2e6fe23f.png","status":{"code":200,"http":"Fetched (ring) 200 600 and parsed 1/91 entries","nextFetch":1505200,"lastFetch":1505200,"lastParse":1505200,"lastMaintenanceAt":1505116,"period":600,"velocity":5.4,"popularity":0,"entriesCountSinceLastMaintenance":6,"feed":"https://www.theguardian.com/uk/technology/rss"}},"language":"en"}]}
