Thanks to a new innovative study, researchers have a better idea of where these pollutants come from -- which ones come from chemicals leaching out of building materials and which ones from the personal items people bring into their homes. The findings could inform the development of new green building standards and lead to healthier housing, especially for low-income communities.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912093138.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Air quality in 'green' housing affected by toxic chemicals in building materials","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912093138.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912093133.htm","published":1505223093,"updated":1505223093,"title":"How should we handle boys who can't read?","summary":"Boys are much worse at reading than girls.
