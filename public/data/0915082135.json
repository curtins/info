The trilobite-like arthropod lived in huge numbers in Scandinavia a half-billion years ago. Today, this extinct species provides important clues for science in several ways.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915103550.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Celebrity fossil reveals all for science","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915103550.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Celebrity fossil reveals all for science","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170915103550-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095300.htm","published":1505483580,"updated":1505483580,"title":"Humans no longer have ancient defense mechanism against viruses","summary":"Insects and plants have an important ancient defense mechanism that helps them to fight viruses. This is encoded in their DNA. Scientists have long assumed that vertebrates -- including humans -- also had this same mechanism. But researchers have found that vertebrates lost this particular asset in the course of their evolution.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095300.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Humans no longer have ancient defense mechanism against viruses","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170915095300.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
