In past experiments, diversity has fostered healthier, more productive ecosystems, like shoreline vegetation that guards against hurricanes. However, many experts doubted whether these experiments would hold up in the real world. A study offers a decisive answer: biodiversity's power in the wild surpasses experimental predictions, in some cases topping even effects of climate.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122625.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Biodiversity just as powerful as climate change for healthy ecosystems","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122625.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Biodiversity just as powerful as climate change for healthy ecosystems","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170911122625-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911095925.htm","published":1505138365,"updated":1505138365,"title":"Looking stressed can help keep the peace","summary":"Scratching may have evolved as a communication tool to help social cohesion, new research suggests for the first time.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911095925.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Looking stressed can help keep the peace","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911095925.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Looking stressed can help keep the peace","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170911095925-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907142743.htm","published":1504808863,"updated":1504808863,"title":"Scientists make methanol using air around us","summary":"Scientists have created methanol from methane using oxygen from the air. Methanol is currently produced by breaking down natural gas at high temperatures. But researchers have discovered they can produce methanol from methane through simple catalysis that allows methanol production at low temperatures using oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The findings have major implications for cleaner, greener industrial processes worldwide.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907142743.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Scientists make methanol using air around us","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170907142743.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Scientists make methanol using air around us","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170907142743-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
