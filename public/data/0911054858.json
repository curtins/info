This question concerns scientists for more than a century. Through the investigation of the embryonic development of sea anemones, a very old animal lineage, researchers have now come to conclusions which challenge the 150-year-old hypothesis of the homology (common evolutionary origin) of the germ layers that form all later organs and tissues.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122644.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"The evolutionary origin of the gut","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170911122644.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"The evolutionary origin of the gut","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170911122644-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
