Getting exposed to more than one -- because they may work together to cause an infection, new research suggests. And trying different antibiotics to control one such 'superbug' may only encourage others. The researchers say it's time to think about such bacteria as members of an antibiotic-resistant ecosystem in healthcare environments -- not as single species that act and respond alone.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134852.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"'Superbug' bacteria gang up on us, fueled by antibiotic use, nursing home study suggests","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134852.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134833.htm","published":1505238513,"updated":1505238513,"title":"Microscope invented at marine biological laboratory illuminates chromosomal 'dark matter'","summary":"Biologists, instrument developers, and computational scientists have for the first time measured the density of a relatively inscrutable, highly condensed form of chromosomal material (heterochromatin) that appears in the cells of human beings and other eukaryotes.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134833.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Microscope invented at marine biological laboratory illuminates chromosomal 'dark matter'","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912134833.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Microscope invented at marine biological laboratory illuminates chromosomal 'dark matter'","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170912134833-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
