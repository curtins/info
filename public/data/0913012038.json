A new study describes how administration of histamine-producing gut microbes to mice lacking the enzyme histidine decarboxylase (HDC) reduced inflammation and tumor formation. These results suggest that alteration of the gut microbiome with probiotics may become a new preventative or therapeutic strategy for patients at risk for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)-associated CRC.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084437.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"New research on probiotics in the prevention and treatment of colon cancer","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913084437.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"}]}
