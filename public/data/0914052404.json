Producing such components en masse has been a major challenge. But now, researchers report that they have developed a way to help meet this need by printing electronics that can fold themselves into a desired shape.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913104537.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Self-folding electronics could enable advanced robotics","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170913104537.htm","type":"text/html"}],"thumbnail":[{"title":"Self-folding electronics could enable advanced robotics","rel":"thumbnail","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/images/2017/09/170913104537-large.jpg","type":"image/jpeg"}]},"language":"en"}]}
