With an annual combined attendance of 1,442,200 people for the two museums (the Legion of Honor and the de Young), FAMSF sought a way to expand the experience for attendees beyond the reach of the physical exhibits themselves and to deepen visitors’ engagement with the art. From this goal, the idea of ‘Digital Stories’ was born.</p>\n<h3>Project Highlights</h3>\n<ul><li>A media-rich, modular template built on Drupal 8</li>\n<li>Innovative feature components to create context with a variety of content</li>\n<li>Expansion of existing brand elements to create cohesive but unique identities</li>\n</ul><p>Project urls: digitalstories.famsf.org/summer-of-love and digitalstories.famsf.org/early-monet/</p></div></div></div>","permalinkUrl":"https://www.drupal.org/node/2908050","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.drupal.org/node/2908050","type":"text/html"}],"replies":[{"title":"Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco","rel":"replies","href":"https://www.drupal.org/node/2908050#comments","type":"text/html"}]},"actor":{"displayName":"alexandra.brandt","id":"alexandra.brandt"},"language":"en"}]}
