DNA methylation, one mechanism of epigenetics, is a chemical tag on DNA that does not change the gene sequence but is involved in controlling gene expression.","permalinkUrl":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912102819.htm","standardLinks":{"alternate":[{"title":"Father's environmental exposure affects sperm epigenetics, study shows","rel":"alternate","href":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912102819.htm","type":"text/html"}]},"language":"en"},{"id":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/09/170912102816.htm","published":1505226496,"updated":1505226496,"title":"Coffee and bees: New model of climate change effects","summary":"Areas in Latin America suitable for growing coffee face predicted declines of 73-88 percent by 2050.
